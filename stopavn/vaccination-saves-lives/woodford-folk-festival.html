		<h1>Stop The AVN sends Woodford Folk Festival a celestial message!</h1>

<p>The Stop The AVN plane flew boldly above the Woodford Folk Festival today, and coverage is pouring in! This page will be updated as links arrive!</p>
<h2>The Press Release</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/76694369/SAVN-Media-Release-Banner-Tow">Stop The Australian Vaccination Network's press release</a></p>

<h2>Blogosphere coverage</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Daniel Raffaele, Stop The AVN founder says:
		<blockquote>It is why the #WoodfordFF hashtag now has an inextricable partner in the #StopAVN hashtag on Twitter. It is why the Woodford Folk Festival's reputation is tarnished . They are giving a stage and a microphone to someone who's facile ranting should not be heard outside her own nut farm.</blockquote>

	</li>
	<li>Mochuck asks:
		<blockquote>This is the work of 34 citizen activists from SAVN who pooled together the $2,800 cost of the plane and towbanner.  These activists include students, pensioners, health professionals and other committed lay people.  It should also be noted that $2,800 represents only 1% of AVN's audited revenue for 2010.  Where did that money go?

	</li>
<li>Dave The Happy Singer adds:
		<blockquote>It's not about censorship, and it's not about free speech. Bill Hauritz, Woodford's cowardly lion, should be ashamed.</blockquote>

<li>Jason Brown, the Drunken Madman offers:
		<blockquote>This is where an easily handled PR pothole turned into a gaping rift of public disapproval. Folk festival promotes known health danger. Organiser unapologetic. Public furious.</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Over at Online Opinion, Chrys Stevenson chimes in:
		<blockquote>If you happen to be in the vicinity of the Woodford Folk Festival this afternoon and there's any chance you might be swayed by the rapid-fire, baffle-them-with-bullshit stylings of anti-vaccination virago, Meryl Dorey, I have a suggestion. Stop for a moment and cast your eyes aloft </blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Everyone's favourite blogging teacher Mike Stuchbery fumes:
		<blockquote>It's when those irrational beliefs and the people who peddle them start to have a tangible deleterious effect on people that my live-and-let live nature disappears and I become angry. None make me more angry than Meryl Dorey and her Australian Vaccination Network.</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Bruce Lllama is not happy:
		<blockquote>The whole reason disease and sickness have been largely removed from our Australian society is because people vaccinate.  It's an important responsibility living in such an egalitarian society. To suggest that people should now have the choice is irresponsible and just plain foolish.</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Over at In Your Face, 'Aspie Warrior' points out that Woodford has previously described Meryl Dorey as:
		<blockquote>A career researcher and Australia's leading expert in vaccination:</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Purplefae reminds us:
		<blockquote>I'm turning 23 next month and I'm so grateful to live in a time where I do not have to watch my family and friends suffer from polio. Where the medical advances so many of us take for granted are saving lives right now. Our grandparents tell us of the horrors they and their loved ones before them faced when they had no defense against diseases like measles that took so many lives. It seems to us younger ones living now, that it's all just a thing of a past.</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>And Skeptical Skotty bemoans:
		<blockquote>...a cornucopia of hippy love and light, music, organic food and unfortunately alt med practitioners pushing whatever flavour of woo that takes their fancy (they even have a homeopathic "first aid" tent, for when you know - you are dehydrated or something)</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Mooslet tests our memory:
		<blockquote>It's a smallpox vaccine scar.  I was one of the first cohort of children in Boston not to get this vaccination. It's not because my parents were against vaccination, but rather because due to the overwhelming success of the smallpox eradication program it was not necessary.</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Random Thoughts From Rosalie asks:
		<blockquote>Why should this woman be given a platform to provide incorrect and misleading health information? To do so is not only dangerous to public health and bad PR for Woodford Folk Festival, it also goes against the policy of some of the festival's main sponsors,  Moreton Bay Regional Council and the Queensland Government.</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>A sober reminder from Eggrings:
		<blockquote> Most people don't realise that these diseases can result in hospitalisation, long term health concerns and even death.  This is seriously scary stuff!  There is literally a 'body count' associated with anti-vax lies.</blockquote>
		<a href="http://eggrings.blogspot.com/2011/12/things-are-looking-up-vaccination-saves.html">http://eggrings.blogspot.com/2011/12/things-are-looking-up-vaccination-saves.html</a>
	</li>
<li>Over at Science@Home, Deb underlines:
		<blockquote>We are dedicated to taking the fight against the misinformation of the AVN off the internet and into the real world</blockquote>

	</li>
<li>Token Skeptic is happy:
		<blockquote>The world doesn't seem such a bad place to be in. At least not today.</blockquote>
		<a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/tokenskeptic/2011/12/29/and-then-like-a-stoptheavn-plane-appearing-in-the-sky/">http://freethoughtblogs.com/tokenskeptic/2011/12/29/and-then-like-a-stoptheavn-plane-appearing-in-the-sky/</a>
	</li>
<li>At Godless Business, askegg draws a familiar comparison:
		<blockquote>Anyone familiar with the anti-evolution nonsense of creationists will be familiar with the AVN’s strategy of cloaking itself as 'presenting both sides of the argument', 'providing an alternative view', or 'free speech'. </blockquote>
		<a href="http://www.godless.biz/2011/12/29/vaccinations-save-lives/">http://www.godless.biz/2011/12/29/vaccinations-save-lives/</a>
	</li>
<li>Seatbelts are an apt analogy for Lucky Losing's imagination:
		<blockquote>Before the road safety industry began these highly lucrative fear campaigns urging people to listen to the police and to these so-called scientists, cars had no seat belts or safety devices and roads were made of dirt and sand. Children were carried on their mothers laps, and windscreens were clean non-toxic glass. Now, we're trapped behind toxic lamination full of chemicals, that break away and float about the interior of the car causing illness, cancer and failure to thrive in children. They also poison breast milk. </blockquote>
